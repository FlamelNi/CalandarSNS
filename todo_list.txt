2.Data

user login using google auth

google firestore for now(?)
    other database would be better, but this is easier to install. Not finalized atm

need to host this to working domain as well



3.Logic/feature

public/friendly/private/secret schedules
    public: anyone can see this event and its details
    friendly: only friends can see this event and its details. Hidden for non-friends
    private: only friends can see this event exists, but not its details. Hidden for non-friends
    secret: hidden for everyone

group event creation
    If group creation is initiated, it creates new group event room that can be linked from group event view
    Room should be able to invite a friend to the event. (Friend has to accept in notification)
    Room should also provide week/month view and find non-overlapping space for groups to decide time for this event.
    Once finalized by room leader, this creates event for each users week/month views. Privacy is automatically set to private, but this can be changed individually
    Users can still access this room after it is finalized, and room leader can change its detail if needed
